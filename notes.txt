Video Thread seek:

Issue with current time.

//Unable to free queue?? (init queue sound)

//Settings: bit rate as setting option.

//choose a codec that supports rgb565 so encoding load is minimal.

//encoded video playback speed has some issues.

//perhaps player is playing too fast. (maybe not, just recording was skipping frames)


//Settings Ideas
